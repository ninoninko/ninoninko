- 👋 Hi, I’m @ninoninko or better known by my friends as Yanaki Krastev. 
I am a twenty-one-year-old bulgarian, who is a Computer Science and Engineering 
bachelor student at Sofia Technical University and I have previously studied at
Delft University of Technology, Kingdom of the Netherlands.

- 👀 I’m interested in C# programming and more specifically - Game development,
although I have no real experience in the field.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# but I have studied Java, C, C++,
SQL, Assembly and other programming languages as a part of my bachelor program.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyproject which may 
be of interest to me. Hit me up if you have a suggestion!

- 📫 I am fairly easy to be reached:
